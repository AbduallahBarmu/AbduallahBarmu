since I am coming from a Computer Engineering background, I have built my field base with good knowledge 
In algorithms and data structures that makes me more effective in the work environment. 

And as we all know  building relationships with people from different cultures is the key to building diverse communities 
I had the opportunity to work with people from different religions and ethnicities as a team member and during our work I have learned so many things,
how to build strong and caring relationships based on trust, understanding and improve my communication skills to share my goals 

I also work as hard as I can until I reach a stage of balance which I feel stable and have a sense of harmony in my life.
Balance is an important thing in our lives, even in the simplest things, time for rest,time for work  etc .
